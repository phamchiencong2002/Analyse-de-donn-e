# Data Analysis Labs â€“ Python Notebooks

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate essential data analysis techniques using Python. These labs were created as part of my coursework in data science and cover foundational skills in data manipulation, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.

## Contents

### 1. `TP_Initiation.ipynb` â€“ *Python & Pandas Initiation*
- Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
- Basic use of **Pandas** for data handling
- Reading, exploring, and cleaning datasets
- Descriptive statistics and simple visualizations
- ðŸ§° Tools: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### 2. `TP_ACP.ipynb` â€“ *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*
- Understanding the need for dimensionality reduction
- Applying **PCA** to real-world datasets
- Interpreting eigenvalues and principal components
- Visualizing results with scatter plots and biplots
- ðŸ§° Tools: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `numpy`

### 3. `TP_Clustering.ipynb` â€“ *Unsupervised Clustering*
- Introduction to unsupervised learning
- Performing **K-Means clustering**
- Evaluating cluster quality (Elbow method, silhouette scores)
- Visualizing clusters in 2D space
- ðŸ§° Tools: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`
